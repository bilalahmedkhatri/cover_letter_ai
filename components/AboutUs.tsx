            <p>
                I am Bilal Ahmed, a software developer and career enthusiast passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-200">How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                This tool uses Google's powerful Gemini AI model to analyze the information you provideâ€”your skills, your experience, and the details of the opportunity you're pursuing. It then generates a letter that is not only well-written but also tailored to highlight your unique strengths in the most effective way.
